## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- FontAwesome Icons

### What I learned

I learned how to setup and use TailwindCSS! It was my first project with this framework and I am happy with the results and the process involved with it. I learned how to make a good navbar menu that dropdowns when clicked on mobile devices (even though it's not the exactly result that I wanted)

### Continued development

Keep learning using TailwindCSS and making more interesting responsive navbar.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This was definitly the resource that I used the most during the construction of the website.
- [CSSTricks flexbox guite](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is a guide that helped me remembering how some flex properties work.
